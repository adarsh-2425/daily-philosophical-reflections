# Daily Philosophical Reflections

## Project Description:
"Daily Philosophical Reflections" is a web application that allows users to record their daily philosophical thoughts and reflections. Users can create, read, update, and delete their philosophical entries for each day. This project is built using NestJS as the backend framework and MongoDB as the database.

## Key Features:

1. User Authentication:

- Users can sign up and log in securely using their email and password.
- Passwords should be hashed and securely stored in the database.
- Implement JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for authentication.

2. Daily Philosophical Entries:

- Users can create a new philosophical entry for each day.
- Each entry contains a title, date, and the user's reflection or philosophical thought for that day.
- Users can edit or delete their entries at any time.
- View and Edit Previous Entries:
- Users can view and edit their past philosophical entries for reference or updates.

3. MongoDB Database:

- Utilize MongoDB as the database to store user profiles and daily philosophical entries.
- Define MongoDB schemas and models to manage user data and entries.

## Technologies and Tools:

- NestJS for the backend.
- MongoDB as the NoSQL database, using Mongoose for data modeling.
- JWT for user authentication and authorization.

## Learning Objectives:

- Build a full-stack application with NestJS and MongoDB, focusing on simplicity.
- Implement user authentication and secure storage of user credentials.
- Create RESTful API endpoints for CRUD operations on daily philosophical entries.
- Work with a NoSQL database (MongoDB) for efficient data storage.
- Apply best practices for code structure, validation, and security.
